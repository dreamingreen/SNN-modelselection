# SNN-modelselection
This is a notebook made for a kaggle challenge made by our teacher. We competed against other students to get the best score at the end.
Here is more detail on the dataset I used, it's AT4:

AFTER_TRAINING with 4 classes (AT4): obtained with the same network (trained with 2 classes), after a short STDP-based unsupervised training using all four classes

This part of the project is about selecting the best model with the best parameters, by choosing the classifiers of our choice, according (mainly!) to the training and testing accuracy for the dataset.
